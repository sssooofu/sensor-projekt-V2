## BNC Panel Mount

The PCB uses a right-angle PCB-mount BNC for internal connection. The external BNC on the enclosure wall is a separate panel-mount connector connected via a short RG174 coaxial pigtail (50–100 mm).

1. Drill a 10 mm hole in the enclosure wall at the BNC position
2. Insert panel-mount BNC (Amphenol 31-221-RFX), secure with lock nut and washer
3. Solder a 75–100 mm RG174 pigtail: center conductor to PCB BNC center pin, shield to PCB BNC shell / VREF_MID trace
4. Apply silicone sealant around the BNC nut on the outside

## Gore-Tex Vent Plug (mandatory for outdoor use)

**Part**: Wiska VMK 16 or equivalent IP67-rated vent plug.

**Why**: a fully sealed IP67 enclosure experiences pressure/temperature cycling outdoors. Without a vent, warm air inside the enclosure during the day creates condensation when it cools at night. The Gore-Tex membrane passes water vapor but not liquid water — preventing internal condensation without compromising weather protection.

Install one vent plug in the bottom face of the enclosure (lowest point for drainage if any moisture enters).

## Assembly Notes

1. Drill all holes using a step drill bit in polycarbonate — avoid twist drills (crack risk)
2. Install cable glands hand-tight, then 1/4 turn with pliers — do not overtighten
3. Apply silicone sealant (neutral cure, not acetic acid cure) around:
   - PCB standoff mounting screws
   - BNC lock nut
   - USB-C panel connector
4. Route sensor cables with a drip loop before entering cable glands (prevents water tracking)
5. Lid torque: finger-tight + 1/4 turn — overtightening cracks polycarbonate lid
6. Supplied gasket is replaceable; check condition annually if unit is in direct rain exposure
7. Label cable glands with UV-stable vinyl labels or permanent marker (sensor type)

## Mounting

Mount on a stake, post, or bracket using M3/M4 stainless bolts through the enclosure wall or base. Avoid mounting flat against a wall — leave at least 10 mm air gap behind for heat dissipation.

Orientation: BNC connector side toward the nearest sheltered location (garden wall, planter edge) to protect the pH probe connection from direct rain impact.
