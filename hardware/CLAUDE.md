# Hardware Agent

PCB design for the Pico W sensor hub. This subproject owns all electrical design. No firmware or server code here.

## What's in this folder

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docs/schematic.md` | **Source of truth** for all electrical connections (ASCII schematic + netlist table) |
| `docs/bom.csv` | Bill of materials — part numbers, quantities, CHF prices |
| `docs/pcb_guidelines.md` | Layout rules: analog zone, relay clearance, ground plane |
| `docs/enclosure.md` | Enclosure selection, cable glands, vent plug |
| `kicad/sensor_hub.*` | KiCad 10 project files — draw schematic manually using schematic.md as reference |

An empty V1 skeleton also exists at `../PCB/V1 pico sensorhub/` (historical, ignore).

## Key Design Constraints

### Analog zone (bottom-left PCB quadrant)
- Copper pour keepout on both layers under AD8603 and 10 MΩ resistors
- Route the high-impedance node (between 10 MΩ and AD8603 IN+) with a guard ring tied to AD8603 output — this eliminates PCB surface leakage that corrupts pH readings
- Single-point AGND/DGND join at ADS1115 AGND pin
- Separate 3V3_ANA pour fed by AP2112K LDO (isolated from digital 3V3)

### Relay (right board edge)
- 4 mm minimum creepage between relay contact traces and any logic net
- 1N4148 flyback diode directly across relay coil pads
- Relay coil driven from VSYS (5V), not 3V3

### BNC connector (left board edge)
- Right-angle PCB-mount BNC at board edge
- 10 MΩ input resistor + BAV99 ESD protection before op-amp
- BNC shield connects to VREF (1.65V virtual mid-rail), NOT to GND — this shifts the pH electrode's ±414 mV output into the ADS1115's positive input range

### General
- 2-layer FR4, 1.6 mm, ENIG finish recommended
- 100 nF decoupling within 0.5 mm of every IC VCC pin
- 10 µF bulk at VSYS entry, AP2112K output, ADS1115 VDD

## BOM Update Process

1. Edit `docs/bom.csv` — one row per component
2. Verify every part in the BOM appears in `docs/schematic.md` netlist
3. Update component values in KiCad schematic to match

## KiCad Note

The `kicad/` skeleton files are in KiCad 10 format. Draw the schematic manually using `docs/schematic.md` as reference. Do not try to auto-generate KiCad XML — draw it in the KiCad application.
